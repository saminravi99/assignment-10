    "review": "The menu at the restaurant is a unique concept with many diverse options. We shared the Cobb salad with roasted heirloom carrots and creamy garlic dressing. The full salad was served with a unique side of French fries, which looked amazing and were deliciously crispy. Our sister ordered the Cobb salad with smoked chicken."

    "review": "The Cornbread & Greens (cole slaw, green tomato relish, lettuce, cucumber, red onion, croutons, and feta cheese) was more flavorful and rounded with the addition of onions, tomatoes, cucumbers, and feta. We both loved the sauce on our heirloom carrots. The slightly sweet onion relish enhanced our enjoyment of the dish."

    "review": "We ordered the Cast Iron skillet with applewood smoked smoked bacon, tomato, green onion, roasted red peppers, and Jack cheese. The skillet was piping hot and the whole meal came together in a way that combined our favorite flavors and textures. The kale and caramelized onions made us even more satisfied."
